# self-driving_car
This is a simple self driving car simulation built using HTML canvas and Javascript<br />
Implemented simple car physics to move the car using keys<br />
Simulated the sensors which work by ray casting<br />
Implemented collision detection using segment intersection<br />
The brain of the car is a simple neural network which is optimized
using a generic algorithm<br />
