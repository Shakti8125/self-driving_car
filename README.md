# self-driving_car
This is a simple self driving car simulation built using HTML canvas and Javascript
Implemented simple car physics to move the car using keys
Simulated the sensors which work by ray casting
Implemented collision detection using segment intersection
The brain of the car is a simple neural network which is optimized
using a generic algorithm
